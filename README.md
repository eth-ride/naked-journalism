# Naked Journalism

**Strengthening press freedom by redesigning its financial foundations.**

A blockchain-powered journalism platform that directly connects readers to journalists through micropayments, eliminating advertiser dependence and ensuring editorial independence.

## The Problem

Modern journalism faces critical challenges that compromise its integrity:

- **Mkubwa Anasema > The Truth** - Authority overrides facts
- **Politically Correct > Editorial Independence** - Self-censorship over honest reporting
- **Ads > Press Freedom** - Revenue models compromise journalistic integrity

## The Solution

Naked Journalism creates a public marketplace where citizens directly support the journalism they value through:

- **Free Content Access** - All stories are free to read, no paywalls or subscriptions
- **Optional Tipping** - Readers can tip journalists to support quality work
- **Instant Transparent Payments** - Journalists earn immediately with full transparency
- **Crowdfunded Investigations** - Public funding for in-depth reporting
- **Zero Advertiser Dependence** - Editorial freedom through direct reader support
- **Multiple Payment Options** - Mobile money (M-Pesa), crypto (USDC, ETH), and bank transfers

## How It Works

1. **Journalist publishes a story** on the platform
2. **Readers access content for free** - no paywalls or subscriptions required
3. **Readers can tip journalists** to support their work using multiple payment methods (mobile money, crypto, bank transfer)
4. **Readers can fund follow-up investigations** through crowdfunding for deeper reporting
5. **Journalists receive transparent payments** with full visibility on funding sources
